# alphaSynth

alphaSynth is a Midi Synthesizer written in Haxe. Currently is alphaSynth a Flash Based synthesizer and requires at least Flash v11.4 installed on the client side. Future versions of alphaTab will try to use HTML5 WebWorkers and Web Audio API for generating and playing the audio. 

This library can load SoundFont2 and Midi Files and generate the raw audio samples needed for playback.
