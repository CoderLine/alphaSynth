# alphaSynth

alphaSynth is a Midi Synthesizer written in Haxe. alphaSynth is a cleaned up port of the C# Synth Project (https://csharpsynthproject.codeplex.com/). 
This library can load SoundFont2 and Midi Files and generate the raw audio samples needed for playback. 

Currently alphaSynth targets the flash platform but for the future we plan to use HTML5 workers and Web Audio API for playback.
